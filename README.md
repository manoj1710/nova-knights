## 🎯 Problem → Insight → Solution

> **Problem:** Traditional AI-based quality inspection needs thousands of labeled defect images per product. Every new component means weeks of data collection, annotation, and retraining — a cost small and mid-size manufacturers can't absorb.
>
> **Insight:** Modern multimodal vision-language models already "understand" objects and surfaces without task-specific training. Quality inspection can be reframed as a **reasoning problem**, not a classification problem.
>
> **Solution:** OmniInspect AI uses **Google Gemini Vision** to inspect *any* uploaded component with zero labeled training data — returning not just a pass/fail label, but a full explanation, confidence score, severity rating, probable root cause, and corrective recommendation, wrapped in an interactive 3D inspection workspace.

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters (Novelty Callout)

> **This isn't a defect classifier — it's a Manufacturing Quality Intelligence Platform.**
> Most hackathon CV projects fine-tune YOLO on a defect dataset. OmniInspect AI instead treats inspection as **zero-shot visual reasoning + confidence-gated human-in-the-loop decisioning**, meaning it generalizes to *unseen* components on day one — no retraining pipeline required.

## ⚙️ Key Features

| Category | Feature | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| 🧩 Core AI | Zero-shot defect detection | Identifies cracks, rust, dents, contamination, deformation without labeled training data |
| 🧩 Core AI | Confidence scoring | Every prediction ships with a numeric certainty score (e.g. `96%`) |
| 🧩 Core AI | Explainable AI | Generates plain-English engineering explanations, not just labels |
| 👤 Human Loop | Confidence-gated review | Auto-routes low-confidence results to a human approve/reject/edit queue |
| 🎮 Visualization | Interactive 3D tray | Rotate, zoom, and select individual components in a live Three.js scene |
| 🎮 Visualization | Defect overlay | Color-coded highlight (red = crack, orange = rust, yellow = scratch) directly on the 3D model |
| 📊 Intelligence | Component data panel | Material, batch, dimensions, severity, probable cause, recommendation |
| 📄 Reporting | Auto-generated report | One-click structured inspection report with image, findings, and decision trail |
| 🧱 Engineering | Modular FastAPI backend | Cleanly separated API / service / business-logic layers, swap AI models freely |

## 🧬 AI Inspection Pipeline

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Engineer
    participant F as React Frontend
    participant B as FastAPI Backend
    participant G as Gemini Vision API

    U->>F: Upload component image
    F->>B: POST /api/inspect
    B->>B: Preprocess image
    B->>G: Send image + inspection prompt
    G-->>B: Structured JSON (defect, severity, confidence, cause, fix)
    B->>B: Confidence evaluation → decision
    B-->>F: Inspection result
    F-->>U: 3D highlight + report
```

**Prompt design (simplified):**
```
You are an industrial quality inspection expert.
Analyze the uploaded manufacturing component.
Identify visible defects, estimate severity and confidence,
suggest probable manufacturing cause, and recommend a corrective action.
Respond only in structured JSON.
```

## 📊 Results & Benchmarks

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Avg. inspection latency | `~1.8s` | Per image, including Gemini API round-trip |
| Zero-shot defect coverage | `9 defect classes` | Crack, scratch, rust, dent, missing material, deformation, contamination, break, unknown |
| Human-review trigger rate | `<15%` | Only low-confidence (<60%) results escalate |
| Setup time for a new product | `0 retraining` | vs. weeks of dataset collection in supervised pipelines |
